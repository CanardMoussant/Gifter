Gifter
======

Play! application to deal with Gifts !

This has been developed with Play! 2.6 on the backend side, and Angular 5 on the frontend side. 
This application was mainly created to have fun with the Play! Framework, but is used every year in my family to
organize for the Chrismas Gifts.

It is based on Postgres and Slick to handle the persistent storage, and Silhouette for authentication.

This is deployed with heroku here: http://giftyou.heroku.com
